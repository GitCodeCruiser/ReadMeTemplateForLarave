# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker).

Clone the repository

    git clone 'Git repo http url'

Switch to the repo folder

    cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new pasports key

    php artisan passport:install

update the APP_URL in .env file to your URL

for localhost it is http://localhost:8000/ (with trailing slash)

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone 'Git repo http url'
    cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan passport:install

**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DBSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DBSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

**_Note_** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

## vue dependencies

Install all the dependencies using npm (**Make sure you have node and npm installed**)

    npm install

Make a build for vue

    npm run build

## modify URL PATH IN VUE FILES

    - open the file (UrlConstants.js) on this path
        resources/js/ApiUrl/UrlConstants.js
    - modify the base URL path for API whatever path it is (it will be same api path)
    This will be to make api calls [http://localhost:8000/api]

**_Note_** This path is according to localhost server, you can update it accoridng to where you host it

## Docker (**optional**)

To install with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), run following commands:

```
git clone 'Git http url'
cd chrrrp
cp .env.example.docker .env
docker run -v $(pwd):/app composer install
cd ./docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
docker-compose exec php php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

The api can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api).
